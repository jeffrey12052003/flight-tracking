### Flight Tracking and Ticket Booking System

Data abstraction, run-time polymorphism, inheritance and other OOPS concepts were used to build a flight ticket booking and tracking system. 

Graph concepts have been used to represent an imaginary set of cities as vertices and flight paths as edges.

Dijkstra's Algorithm has been used to find the shortest path between two cities.

This project was programmed using C++.
